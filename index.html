  <p>Hi World!</p>
  <p>I'm a third year bachelor's of science in business and information technology student. I'm a full time student and full time employee. I'm working as an IT helpdesk support analyst.</p>
  <p>This class is in my course curriculum which is one of the reason I took it. Secondly, I like to play around with html and css.</p>
